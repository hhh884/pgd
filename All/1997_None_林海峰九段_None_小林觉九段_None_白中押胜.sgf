;B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fc];W[hc];B[cn];W[fp];B[bp];W[qn]C[jansteen 3d*\: Well, they "go their own way" 
jansteen 3d*\: Difficult position 
jansteen 3d*\: What's direction in lower-right? 
jansteen 3d*\: Question is\: r4 or r8? 
imp NR \: r8 (Kirsten), same for me\:) 
jansteen 3d*\: Why? 
jansteen 3d*\: Right, r8 has two meanings\: attack r6 and develop q16
]
;B[ql];W[qf];B[nc];W[rd]C[jansteen 3d*\: Next move makes sense, ideas? 
jansteen 3d*\: (previous moves made sense too, but next move can be predicted) 
jansteen 3d*\: o17 was played with a purpose 
jansteen 3d*\: What's the hottest place on the board? 
imp NR \: so, black plays f15\:) 
jansteen 3d*\: right imp! 
jansteen 3d*\: Difference between white f16 or black f15 is huge 
jansteen 3d*\: (Fundamentals of Go\: connecting and cutting)
]
;B[fe]C[jansteen 3d*\: This move makes d14 and j16 miai
];W[cf]C[jansteen 3d*\: Next? 
imp NR \: we say j16 
jansteen 3d*\: imp and Kirsten payed attention \:)
]
;B[id]C[jansteen 3d*\: And now two choices\: j17 or e17, which one? 
jansteen 3d*\: Why? 
imp NR \: agree here 
jansteen 3d*\: Right, walking along the top is bad because o17 is waiting
]
;W[ec]C[jansteen 3d*\: Anyone knows next move for black?
];B[ic];W[fb]C[jansteen 3d*\: This trade is fair since white protected the upper-left corner with e17 and f18 
jansteen 3d*\: The usual move for black is g17 here, but there is another hot area, anyone can spot it? 
imp NR \: r12? 
jansteen 3d*\: r12 is not so urgent 
jansteen 3d*\: White's upper-right can settle by either r17 or r11, so not urgent 
imp NR \: hmm, in LR then 
jansteen 3d*\: club got it 
imp NR \: but nothing special there? 
jansteen 3d*\: White played elsewhere after r8, r4 collects interest
]
;B[qp]C[imp NR \: ah, did not think r4 was *that* important \:) 
Pollux 11k \: ;hi. all dans here? 
imp NR \: guess not, normally many strengths participate \:) 
jansteen 3d*\: Next move also makes sense, remember what I said about UL joseki? 
imp NR \: so welcome to join in 
jansteen 3d*\: Think more severe malf 
jansteen 3d*\: You got the idea, just perfection now
]
;W[hd]C[jansteen 3d*\: White takes interest from black's tenuki 
jansteen 3d*\: Next move is must... 
jansteen 3d*\: which?
]
;B[he]C[jansteen 3d*\: Right, h15 only move 
jansteen 3d*\: Just a matter of shape, you don't need to read such a move 
imp NR \: or j15\:) 
jansteen 3d*\: Not j15 imp, h15 would slice through black's position
]
;W[hb]C[jansteen 3d*\: Next move is also basic 
jansteen 3d*\: Which?
];B[ie]C[jansteen 3d*\: Go is very simple game, just shape, cutting and connecting 
jansteen 3d*\: Everybody can play like this 
jansteen 3d*\: Right, nice moment to play elsewhere, where? 
jansteen 3d*\: l3? Why? 
jansteen 3d*\: l3 protects h3, when black enters anyway white can still o3
]
;W[kq]C[jansteen 3d*\: Usually l3 is miai with another move 
jansteen 3d*\: Otherwise white's shape would become too perfect 
jansteen 3d*\: Which move? 
imp NR \: c3 must, then w o3 
jansteen 3d*\: Good imp!
]
;B[cq];W[nq]C[jansteen 3d*\: I would block at d3 instead of o3 
jansteen 3d*\: Would d3 be possible as well? 
imp NR \: o3 gives b difficulties in the corner, keeps it slightly weak 
jansteen 3d*\: ok 
jansteen 3d*\: Black has to move out of the corner now 
jansteen 3d*\: again\: cutting (r6 and o3) 
imp NR \: b has to do something in LR, which proves o3 better than d3\:) 
jansteen 3d*\: There is a traditional combination here, which one? 
jansteen 3d*\: Right club, you are good interpreting hints \:)
]
;B[lp]C[jansteen 3d*\: The combination is\: m4, m3, o4
];W[mr];B[np];W[kp];B[oq]
;W[lo]C[jansteen 3d*\: The usual pro-magic playing with shapes 
jansteen 3d*\: Both go their own way 
jansteen 3d*\: direction is correct club, shape? 
imp NR \: f2 now? 
imp NR \: or q7 defence?
]
;B[mn]C[jansteen 3d*\: n6 goes ahead of white 
imp NR \: better than q7 this\:) 
jansteen 3d*\: White of course wants to use r6 most efficient way, but preparation is necessary, next? 
imp NR \: r17? 
jansteen 3d*\: r10 very direct (leaves weakness at r12) 
jansteen 3d*\: r17 is big, but urgent move before big one 
imp NR \: or d3? 
jansteen 3d*\: d3 only one purpose\: defending territory
]
;W[ph]C[jansteen 3d*\: This move radiates power all over the place 
jansteen 3d*\: Suddenly white q7 becomes an option, or l17 as well 
jansteen 3d*\: Besides, when black plays first at right side (r12), LR becomes very large and... 
imp NR \: I think I understand this\: has to do something against b r12, this better than corner 
jansteen 3d*\: r6 is eaten the largest possible way 
jansteen 3d*\: Black defends against q7, how? 
imp NR \: q10? 
jansteen 3d*\: q10 correct idea but no follow-up move against white's position
]
;B[qj]C[jansteen 3d*\: Next one logical as well, imp? 
jansteen 3d*\: r11 would be defense only 
imp NR \: p10, or maybe q9?
]
;W[qc]C[imp NR \: should have known\:) 
jansteen 3d*\: r17 is\: 1. big, 2. defense 3. attack 
jansteen 3d*\: Well, of course black doesn't defend with q17 here but seeks own ways, where? 
jansteen 3d*\: q17 would be similar to d3 kind of move\: one purpose 
jansteen 3d*\: Don't think about local situation too much, fly around \:) 
jansteen 3d*\: left side is least interesting area, both low\: c6 and c14
]
;B[fr]C[jansteen 3d*\: This move is\: 1. big 2. attacking potential 
jansteen 3d*\: As you might understand by now white does not defend with something like g3 but also goes own way, where? 
imp NR \: m17 maybe? 
jansteen 3d*\: p18 is not severe enough, direction is correct 
jansteen 3d*\: m17/l17 are equal direction, both correct, l17 more correct 
imp NR \: simply q17?
]
;W[kc]C[jansteen 3d*\: This is shape because of j18 option 
jansteen 3d*\: Go can be very simple game 
jansteen 3d*\: This game is extremely simple and instructive I think 
imp NR \: l16? 
jansteen 3d*\: Nothing special so far, all basic ideas 
jansteen 3d*\: What's difficult for us is to go our own way I think 
jansteen 3d*\: We see the points, but timing and such is difficult 
imp NR \: true\:) 
jansteen 3d*\: Ok, black is risking to be cut in two by l15, so? 
imp NR \: j18 overplay here? 
jansteen 3d*\: j18 definitely overplay, white l15 
jansteen 3d*\: m16 correct direction, black played lighter
]
;B[le]C[imp NR \: but what if n16 now? Couldn't think of good answer. 
jansteen 3d*\: If white n16 black will start fighting with q14 or similar 
jansteen 3d*\: With j18 still there this is an equal fight
]
;W[jb]C[jansteen 3d*\: Why k18? 
jansteen 3d*\: Right, less forcing moves for black now
]
;B[pf];W[pg];B[of]C[jansteen 3d*\: Black takes care of n16 weakness
];W[nh];B[qe]
;W[re]C[jansteen 3d*\: White o12 quite a decision 
jansteen 3d*\: o12 valuable and still aiming thinness in black's top 
jansteen 3d*\: However, black can now ...? 
imp NR \: CUT\:)
]
;B[qg]C[jansteen 3d*\: Right!
];W[rf];B[qh];W[pi];B[qi]C[jansteen 3d*\: Next move\: o9 or m12?
]
;W[nk]C[jansteen 3d*\: o9 prevents black o10 (which attacks and is very big) 
jansteen 3d*\: How will black defend here? What does white want? 
jansteen 3d*\: p8 would be usual way to defend, agree 
jansteen 3d*\: But then o9 would feel very much kikashi and white would take other keypoint (m12) as well 
imp NR \: simply m12?
]
;B[lh]C[jansteen 3d*\: Right imp \:) 
jansteen 3d*\: m12 defends by attacking the white group 
jansteen 3d*\: pro's always look for positive solutions (with multiple meaning) 
jansteen 3d*\: m12 strengthens top and weakens white's group 
jansteen 3d*\: Now fighting comes as you might guess... 
jansteen 3d*\: thousand variations here, I just show the game....
]
;W[mo]C[jansteen 3d*\: n5 wants o6 obviously
];B[no];W[om]C[jansteen 3d*\: Looks like black demolished here 
jansteen 3d*\: But just stay cool and....
]
;B[ok]C[jansteen 3d*\: Now miai of o8 and o10 
jansteen 3d*\: Counter-attack
];W[nl]
;B[ol];W[nn];B[nj]C[jansteen 3d*\: Result\: white cut off n6, black captured q11\: a furikawari
]
;W[oo];B[op];W[mj];B[mi]C[jansteen 3d*\: Who's better? 
jansteen 3d*\: inkarri think b better, club think w better; who's right? \:)
]
;W[lj]C[jansteen 3d*\: White built thickness and saved r6 stone, I think at least equal for white
]
;B[pb]C[jansteen 3d*\: this move is kikashi
];W[pc];B[oc];W[qb]C[jansteen 3d*\: Next sequence is interesting 
jansteen 3d*\: black doesn't want to give center for free...
]
;B[mm]C[jansteen 3d*\: sente
];W[nm];B[kn]C[jansteen 3d*\: Suddenly tables seem turned, next move? 
jansteen 3d*\: Think positive 
imp NR \: m8? 
jansteen 3d*\: m8 correct direction, but m8 stresses defense 
jansteen 3d*\: look for offense \:)
]
;W[kl]C[pizza 1d \: m6 
imp NR \: l12? 
jansteen 3d*\: l8 very positive move
];B[mq]
C[jansteen 3d*\: Treatens l5
];W[ko];B[nr]C[jansteen 3d*\: Another exchange 
jansteen 3d*\: Very interesting
]
;W[er];B[eq];W[fq];B[dr]C[imp NR \: k6 soon i think 
jansteen 3d*\: Next move impossible to find, pro skills come.... 
jansteen 3d*\: The result is spectacular 
imp NR \: m13? 
jansteen 3d*\: very close imp! 
hwong 10k*\: jansteen, you make the game very interesting to watch! 
jansteen 3d*\: thank you hwong \:) 
imp NR \: l13? 
jansteen 3d*\: Try to combine the l17 stone and o11 cut 
imp NR \: m14 also something to think of... 
jansteen 3d*\: yes imp!
]
;W[lf]C[imp NR \: Unfair, the pro's have hours\:) 
jansteen 3d*\: Not hours imp, this is lightning game \:) 
jansteen 3d*\: m14 makes miai of l15 and o11 trouble
]
;B[mf];W[ke];B[kf];W[ni];B[oj];W[lg]C[jansteen 3d*\: What if l13 now? 
jansteen 3d*\: Possible? 
jansteen 3d*\: p16 cutting point left
]
;B[mg];W[kg];B[mh];W[jf]C[jansteen 3d*\: Quite a result, isn't it?
];B[ig];W[kh]
;B[ld];W[kd]C[jansteen 3d*\: Black to play and make shape with top center group, where? 
imp NR \: d13? 
jansteen 3d*\: Good feeling shouzhuo, very close
]
;B[eh]C[jansteen 3d*\: Looks nice too, less heavy than e13 
jansteen 3d*\: No shouzhuo, only one \:)
]
;W[gi];B[de];W[ce];B[df];W[cg];B[hh];W[gh];B[gg];W[fj];B[di];W[dj];B[cj];W[dk];B[bi]
;W[ch];B[ci];W[cl]C[jansteen 3d*\: White plays simple\: keeps black seperated 
jansteen 3d*\: Meanwhile, the center is enlarged
]
;B[cd];W[bd];B[cc]C[jansteen 3d*\: A moment to be careful, where? 
imp NR \: d17? 
imp NR \: we seem not careful\:) 
imp NR \: c18 then
]
;W[dc]C[jansteen 3d*\: I'm not sure what will happen after the usual b17 instead
]
;B[bc];W[be];B[fh];W[co]C[jansteen 3d*\: White wants to close d6 
jansteen 3d*\: So black enters from the other side...
]
;B[ij];W[ii];B[hi];W[hj];B[db];W[eb];B[ca];W[bb];B[ab];W[ba];B[bo];W[dn];B[ji];W[ik]
;B[ih];W[jk];B[gr];W[ep];B[dq];W[hq];B[bh]C[jansteen 3d*\: Black starts the semeai
]
;W[bn];B[ad];W[ae];B[bg];W[ac];B[gq];W[gp];B[ad];W[if];B[hf];W[ac];B[hr];W[iq];B[ad]
C[imp NR \: strange\: w plays as in need of points (b6) 
imp NR \: but seems much agead to me
]
;W[ff];B[ib];W[ac];B[ha];W[ga];B[ia];W[ki];B[gd];W[cb];B[ee];W[ro];B[rp];W[gb]C[jansteen 3d*\: Here black resigned 
imp NR \: very nice game, thx jan 
hwong 10k*\: thanks jansteen 
jansteen 3d*\: Ok, some post-game comments\:.... 
jansteen 3d*\: After black's four stone capture of q11 black was ahead 
jansteen 3d*\: After white's tesuji of m14 white was ahead 
jansteen 3d*\: Thank you all for input and a very lively and interesting analysis, we learned a lot! 
jansteen 3d*\: Ok, I close the game now, pls re-study in private \:)
