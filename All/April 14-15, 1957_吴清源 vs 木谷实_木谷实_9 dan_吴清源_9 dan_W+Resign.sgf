SO["Detailed Analysis of Wu's Famous Games. Vol.3" pp. 95-188. People's Sports [China\], 1986]
;B[qd]C[(* Before WWII, in Japan, the most popular stars in sports were led by Futabayama of sumo [Japanese wrestling\], Kawakami of baseball, Boriguchi of boxing, and Kimura Meijin of shogi.  While in Go, the most honorable, at the top of the world, were none other than the discoverers of "new opennings", 木谷实 and 吴清源 [Wu\].

(* [Now it's post-war time.\] Those famous stars [excluding Wu and Kitani\], at one time or another, have either retired or faded, and only the home run king of baseball, Kawakami, is still able to live up with his fame; he is a rarity.

(* But Wu, since traveling to Japan in 1928 at the age of 14, has held the highest honor in Go, never faded in 30 years. He is truely a genius that would appear only once a few hundred years in Go history. *)]
;W[dc]C[(* Comparing with competitions in which outcome may be decided in a short burst or a split of second, a Go game takes much longer battles to yield a winner and a loser.  This may have told us why Go players' professional careers are longer than that of other sports. *)]
;B[pq]C[(* After WWII, 木谷实's records were down for a while, but since he was promoted to 9 dan last year [1956\], his once unbeatable form appeared again.  Recently he posted an astonishing record of 14 wins and 5 losses.  In major tournaments like the Highest Rank Deciding Matches, Honinbo Matches, and Tokyo Newspaper sponsored Championship Matches, he all recorded triumphs. *)]
;W[oc]C[(* Is the once overwhelming "Wu-Kitani Era" re-emerging?  Gradually recovered, rising giant 木谷实, challenges 吴清源 for the first time in 13 years.  This balanced struggle is indeed the most remarkable post-war battle since the Wu-Fujisawa 10-game series. *)]
;B[cp]C[This is the first game between Kitani 9 dan and me [me = Wu\] after the War.

Before the War, we had a 10-game series when we were 7 dans; later, we also played 4 games.  I remember these 4 games were three games in the Grant Meet (Nihon Kiin's [Japanese Go Association\] ranked players tournament) and one game sponsored by Yomiuri Newspaper.  Finally in 1944 [during the War, that is\], we met again in the ranked players tournament when we were 8 dans.  This game now is my first against Mr. Kitani in 13 years.]
;W[po]C[This game is played in Tokyo Chiyoda District Kioi Street's Fukudake Inn on April 14-15, 1957.  At the same time, the game between 坂田荣男 9 dan and Takagawa Honinbo 8 dan [another of Strongest Deciding Matches\] is also held here.  That game of theirs will end with Sakata 9 dan, playing Black, winning by 4 points.]
;L[qo]B[pp]C[B #7 [Q4\] is Kitani 9 dan's unique move; other players rarely play it, but Kitani 9 dan has used it a few times in openings like the 1-3-5 [R16-Q3-C4\] of this game.

B doesn't want to play B[a\] so that W would play [Q4\] to form the "avalanche shape", so [Q4\] move applies the proverb "opponent's key point is also my key point."]
;W[oo]C[If W #8 extends downwards [R5\] ---

[*** 'B' to see this variation.\]

W #8 extending upwards is solid.]
(;B[qo]C[B #9 hane is big.];W[qn]C[W #10 certainly.

(;B[ro]C[B #11 ---

[*** 'B' to see a variation.\]]
(;L[eq][iq]W[qg]C[W #12 normally plays W[a\].

Kitani 9 dan said in his post-game review that, if W[a\], B had prepared to play B[b\].

In the situation shown in this game, W #12 does have various ways to play.]
;B[pe]C[B #13 of course.];W[qj]C[W #14 is also normal.];L[rn][eq]B[ep]C[B #15 is a big point on the board.

Had #15 been played B[a\], W would certainly ignore it [tenuki\] and play W[b\].]
;W[cf]C[W #16 is also a big point that cannot miss.  This point and B #15 [E4\] are miai [counterbalance moves of same weight\].]
;B[kc]C[B #17 is an extremely good point.

Next move, W #18, is a difficult one. [difficult to find a good spot, that is.\]

[*** 'B' to see what Wu had in mind for a possible W #18.\]]
(;W[oe]C[[Instead,\] W adopted [P15\] to attach.  Next move ---

[*** 'B' to see a variation for B #19.\]]
(;B[pg]C[So B simply presses at [Q13\] is tesuji.

[*** 'B' to see a reference diagram that explains more why B #19 shouldn't play at [P14\].\]

How should W play next move #20? ---

[*** 'C' to see variation 1.\]
[*** 'D' to see variation 2.\]]
(;W[pd]C[[Instead,\] W #20 to squeeze here is a good move.];B[qe]C[B #21 certainly.]
;L[qc]W[of]C[If W #22 hane with [a\] ---

[*** 'B' to see this variation.\]

So W #22 extends at [P14\] is good.

[*** 'C' to see a variation for B next move, #23\]]
(;B[pf]C[Therefore, B #23 has no choice but [Q14\].];W[qc]C[W, as a result, gets #24 and ...]
;B[rc];W[qb]C[... #26 to settle down the corner.  This local fight thus comes to a pause.]
;L[qh][ic]B[hc]C[If B[a\] for #27, that would be a good point too, but then W would certainly play W[b\], and [b\] is a point that cannot be missed.

B #27 as played [H17\] is an extremely big point.]
;W[qh]C[But then W gets #28 [R12\] key point, and W is in a form to attack B.];L[nh]
B[og]C[If B #29 tenuki [plays elsewhere\], W[a\] and B big chunk is captured.];W[rn]
C[W thus finally gets #30 [S16\].  During this period of conflicts, B never got a chance to play [S16\].]
;L[nq][rq]B[np]C[B #31 is absolutely the only move.

If B tenuki [plays elsewhere\], when Wa[O3\], B has to defend with Bb[S3\]; letting W to seal B with sente is unbearable.]
;W[iq]C[W #32 ---

[*** 'B' to see a variation.\]]
(;L[oi][qi]B[pi]C[B #33 [Q11\] on one hand prevents W[a\] that was described previously [see variation at move #32\], on the other hand aims at B[b\] cut.]
;W[lq]C[If W #34 plays at the right side [around R11\], it would be slow.

[*** 'B' to see how W would handle it if B plays [R11\] now.\]]
(;B[mq]C[B #35's purpose ---

[*** 'B' to see a reference diagram that shows one of B #35's goals.\]

Also...]
(;W[lp];L[pn]B[no]C[...[Also\] B now has #37 to get out, aiming at [a\] cut at the same time.

At this critical point, W made a mistake in the next move.

W #38 [W's next move\] ---

[*** 'B' and 'C' to see variations for W #38 -- that would have been correct.\]]
(;L[mn]W[nn]C[In any case, #38 plays in a wrong direction [summary of variations\: here W should [T5\] first\].

If W[a\] next, it would *not* be a sente move, thus B wouldn't answer it.

[*** 'B' to see why W [N6\] next will not be sente.\]]
(;B[qi]C[Because of W's mistake at #38 [O6\], B finally gets sente, and with that, B cleverly turns to play [R11\].]
;L[ph][oh][oi]W[ri]C[If W can get sente here, W would have W[a\]-B[b\]-W[c\] sequence to extend W's territory at the right side.]
;B[rj];L[rh][rg]W[rk]C[Had B #41 [S10\] played [a\] cut, W would have atari with [b\].  With this kind of shape, "capture the cut stone" is common sense.]
;L[rh][sj][rg]B[pj]C[It would be awkward for B #43 to atari at [a\], forcing W[b\], then B[c\] to get two W stones. [Imagine, for example, after B[c\], W plays [Q10\].\]]
;W[sj]C[W #44 however ---

[*** 'B' to see a variation.\]]
(;B[qk];W[rj];B[pk]C[To here, W is pressed to a low position.  This is the fault of W #38 [O6\].

Next ---

[*** 'B' to see a reference.\]

Therefore, it has become an opening favoring B.]
(;W[mc]C[If W #48 tenuki here ---

[*** 'B' to see a reference.\]]
(;L[ck][ce]B[fc]C[B #49 [F17\] is very good.

On first look [a\] seems to be the real big point for #49.  But if B[a\], W will certainly presses at [F17\].  Then the B teams at upper and right sides would yet have enough eyes, and with two "floating" teams, B would be difficult.

Moreover, now with #49, B creates an opportunity for B[b\] to attack W.]
;W[ck]C[Since B gets [F17\], [C9\] big point is left for W.];B[gq]C[And then B #51 [G3\] becomes clearly the next biggest point.

B #51 could also consider to play at [N6\] [see an earlier reference at move #47\], but that would make it complicated, so B #51 "cashes in" with some territory first. [I guess Wu is saying, since B is leading, no need for him to make it complex.\]]
;L[mn][pm][pn][cm]W[mo]C[W[a\] for #52 is a correct [text\] move, but if W does play [a\], it would be no threat to B's corner [see reference at move #38\].

Also, if W[a\], B[b\] to force W[c\], and B[d\] would give B a clear lead.

Therefore, even though [N5\] for W #52 is not solid, W doesn't have many choices.  This is again the fault of #38 [O6\].

W #52's purpose is to force B repond here, so W can get sente. If B ignores here ---

[*** 'B' to see a reference.\]]
(;B[lr]C[Therefore, B #53 [M2\] and ...];W[kr];B[mr]C[...[and\] #55 [N2\] are necessary.

In short, in order to get sente, W has to make a move like #52 [N5\], although it would leave some weak point.]
;L[mn]W[nj]C[W #56 is the key point to attack.  No matter what, if W doesn't stick with this B group, W will have no way to win.

#56's purpose is to gain opportunities to protect cut at [a\] by attacking B team.  Conversely, B can adopt two difference attitudes, either harder or softer, when he chooses his next plays.  In short, this is the first crisis of the game. 

If B chooses the hardest way to play, that is ---

[*** 'B' to see variation 1 for B #57\]

Therefore, if B chooses the rough tactic shown above [in variation 1\], it won't be satisfactory.

I think if B plays as follows [variations 2 and 3\] would give W a headache.

[*** 'C' and 'D' to see variation 2 and 3.\]]
(;B[nk]C[[Instead,\] W adopted #57 and ...];W[mk];B[nl]C[...[and\] #59.  This is of course the most solid way to play, but ...]
;W[mj]C[...[but\] after W #60 connects, W has somewhat achieved his goal of attacking B.]
;B[oj]C[B #61 ---

[*** 'B' to see a variation.\]]
(;M[po][oo]W[so]C[W #62 is to gain with sente before sacrificing [P5\][Q5\].];B[rq]
;W[ml];B[nm];W[mm]C[If W #66 connects at [N6\] ---

[*** type 'B' to see this variation.\]

(* The big spot at the left side is the key point concerning the trend of both sides' growth.  Here we can see how both sides deliberate intensively over this situation. *)]
(;B[on];W[mn];L[qm]B[pn]C[To here, although W loses two stones, but he gets a spectacular outside thickness in *sente*.  W has managed to gain back what he lost on #38 [O6\].

After B #69, *if* W can gain with [a\], seemingly a sente, then turn to left side, that would be even better for W [than to turn to left directly\].  That is to say ---

[*** 'B' to see reference 1.\]
[*** 'C' to see reference 2.\]]
(;L[rl][ql]W[cn]C[[So Wu said that [R7\] wouldn't be a sente move for W now.  I thought, "Hey, why bother? [C6\] is big, get it first anyway." But the fact is, in this level of games, *every* point is important.  If one passes by a sente move, it could be not sente later.\]

Anyway, W finally gets the chance to occupy the big spot at [C6\], and thus escapes from the previously disadvantageous situation.

At the right side, if B[a\], W[b\] cut would take care of it.]
;B[qm]C[Since W got the big spot at the left edge, letting B to gain here with #71...]
;W[rm];B[ql]C[...and #73 is unavoidable.];W[rl];L[er]B[co]C[B #75 is the way to solidify the corner.  Of course, even if B doesn't play this move, the corner has no problem for now.  But later, when the outside situation changes, then there is a possibility that W will cast in W[a\].  So B #75 now to prevent it.]
;L[dn][bq][bp][er]W[bn]C[W #76 extending downwards decides the growth of both sides' territory.  W[a\] extending upwards would be yielding and passive.

[Also,\] W #76 aims at W[b\]-B[c\]-W[d\].

[The above variation shows that Wa would lead a ko.\] Here, [with #92\] it will also be a ko, but it's an easier ko [for W\].]
(;B[ae]C[B #93, and the huge ko that would determine the result of this game has started.]
;W[be];B[ee];W[fd];B[bf]C[After B #97, W can't find an appropriate ko threat anywhere on the board, how to save such a dangerous situation?]

If W[a\] for #102, B would follow with [G16\], and that's a ko threat for B.]
;B[bh]C[B #103 to pull these few stones [W [A13\] etc.\] into the ko is rather unexpected.

This this the second crisis of the game. [The first was back at move #56.\]

(* Later there will be detailed analysis for B #103.

(* As for this ko, what are the best moves?  Please study it by yourself, then compare your conclusion with B #103. *)]
;W[be];B[rf]C[B #105 threatens a W team that is worth about 50 points.

(* W to answer a move here seems to be unquestionable, since it's hard to imagine that W would sacrifice such a big group.  But 吴清源 9 dan's strategies are often unexpected --- *)]
;W[ad]C[W #106 unhesitatingly finishes the ko.

[He did!  I couldn't believe it. \:)\]]
;M[gd]B[sh]C[B #107, and the right W team is dead.  However, I think with the moyo at the middle, W has more than enough to compete with B.

Therefore, B #103 [B12\] was a questionable move.

In this picture, W G16 [marked\], extending out, gave W's central moyo a big boost in thickness.  So B's best policy at this point was to shift the emphasis to the middle, damaging W's attempt to control the center. Consequently, B #103 should play as the following.

[*** 'B' to see reference 1.\]
[*** 'C' to see reference 2.\]]
(;L[ie][ic][jf][ig]W[en]C[W #108 wrong order.  Before this, W should play W[a\], forcing B[b\], *then* jump at [a\].

Afterwards if B[c\] to do a shallow invasion, W[d\] to fence. This way, from the global point of view, it's a better trade for W.

Also, when W[a\], if B doesn't play B[b\] but jumps at [a\] ---

[*** 'B' to see a reference.\]]
(;B[hd]C[Although B #109 is a correct move [under normal circumstances\], under the current situation, W is better to adopt the following play.

;W[fm]C[This B #117 and W #118 exchange [E8-F7\] is worth a reconsideration [by B\].  Since inside the influence of W thickness, B #117 could easily lead himself to a trap that he cannot escape.

;B[gh]C[(* Since it has developed to this situation, the only way for B to win is to desperately find a way to save this team.
