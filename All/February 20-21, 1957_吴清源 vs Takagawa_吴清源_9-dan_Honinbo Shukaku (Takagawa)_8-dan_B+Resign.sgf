;B[qd]C[(* This game between 吴清源 9-dan and Takagawa Honinbo is the first one since their 1956 10-game series. *)]
;W[dp]C[(* This game was played in a hotel in Atami on February 20 and 21, 1957.  On this day, 坂田荣男 9-dan and 桥本宇太郎 9-dan's game was also played here.  Kitani [Minoru\] 9-dan and Fujisawa [Hosai\] 9-dan also came to watch the games.   All six participants of the Strongest Deciding Matches gathered at the same place -- indeed a rare opportunity. *)]
;B[cd]C[(* In this game, 吴清源 9-dan defied the traditional way of playing the so-called "great avalanche" joseki, making a revolutionary new variation that shocked Japan's Go world. *)

(* Generally speaking, new variations in josekis are made due to the following two reasons\:

(* First, based on the surrounding situation, any known joseki moves is not satisfactory.  Therefore, to fit the current situation, one decides to make a change, thus a new move.

(* Second, contrary to the above case, one has fully studied a new move already, and he attempts to apply it in practice on purpose; or, in a game under appropriate situation, he suddenly realizes it's time to make this new move.

(* In the first case, a new move is made by chance under a special situation, therefore its application is quite limited.

(* Only the new moves made in the second case are purely new moves. The new variation 吴清源 9-dan made has a fundamentally difference in the order of moves with the way everyone had been playing in the most popular "great avalanche" joseki.  Strictly speaking, it's a "revolutionary joseki." This joseki is extremely valuable for study, and it will be widely used hereafter. *)]
;W[pp]C[Playing at hoshi points [stars\] is what Mr. Takagawa likes. In the creation of New Fuseki Era, Mr. Kitani and I had studied san-ren-sei fuseki, and we often played at hoshi points.  Recently Mr. Takagawa often chooses these openings.]
;L[od]B[oc]C[B #5 to enclose at [a\] is also a beautiful move.];L[ec]W[ed]C[W #6 also can approach from a lower position, point [a\].

W played hoshi points at the two corners at the lower side, so he tries to get a high position at the top side as well.  To here, it's an opening also commonly seen if the colors are reversed -- That is, if B gets two hoshi points at the lower side, and W plays two komoku [3-4 points\] at the upper side, B would then play [E16\].]
;L[fc]B[ec]C[When #7, B has already expected that W will choose "avalanche" joseki.

If W[a\] next ---

[*** 'B' to see a reference.\]]
(;W[dd];B[dc];L[fd]W[ce]C[When W #10, if B chooses the joseki at [a\] ([F16\]) hane, it would be inappropriate.

[*** 'B' and 'C' to see the variations.\]]
(;B[fc];L[jp]W[pj]C[W #12 is the biggest point on the board.

This move to play [a\] at the lower side to form san-ren-sei is also a pretty strong formation, but W #12 also prevents B from extending from the komoku shimari [corner enclosure\] at the upper right.  Therefore, #12 is the biggest point.]
;L[jq]B[nq]C[In the past, B #13 had been normally played at [a\] to split the side, but nowadays it's more often played as shown to approach the corner.

B[a\] to split the corner shows an unhurried manner, while B #13 kakari tends to settle a local shape quickly.  This [B #13\] implies the severity of modern fuseki.

When B #13 kakari [approach\] ---

[*** 'B' and 'C' to see the variations.\]]
(;W[pn]C[But [contrary to the pincer moves shown in the variations,\] Mr. Takagawa adopts a simple, easy way -- #14 jump.

This is the most unhurried response.]
;L[jq][qq][kq]B[pr]C[B #15 keima immediately is seen often recently.

If B #15 extends to [a\], after W gets #15 [Q2\], B will have to play [M4\] to prevents W's [M3\] invasion.

B #15's purpose is if W[b\], B[c\] extends.]
;L[qq][kq]W[lq]C[W #16 pincer is popular recently.

In this game, W's strategy is to form moyo in the center, so #16 pincer is certainly the move.  If W[a\]-B[b\], it would be following B's plan.]
;L[no]B[qq]C[If B[a\] jumps instead of #17, after W gets #17 point, B would be losing the base and be under attack; no good.]
;W[oq]C[W #18 is joseki.

If a ladder works for B here ---

[*** 'B' to see a variation.\]]
(;B[or]C[[Therefore,\] B #19 has no choice.];W[np]C[W #20 certainly.];B[ro]C[B #21 this move ---

[*** 'B' to see a variation.\]]
(;L[nr][qm]W[rn]C[W #22 has no other choice.  If W[a\] cuts now, B[b\] "flies" out [An interesting note\: in Chinese Go terminology, the character or word for "keima" is "flying."\], and B is better.]
;B[qo];W[qn];L[nr]B[mp]C[If B #25 connects at [a\], W would get the chance to play #25, and W is easy.

Since B has played #21 keima [S5\] earlier, #25 should not play at [a\].  The reason for #21 is just to prepare for #25 hane. #21 and #25 are related moves.

B #25's purpose is ---]
;W[mq]C[Although W #26 and...];B[nr];W[mo]C[[And\] #28 captures one B stone, but W eventually will have to spend one more move to finish the capture.  Thus, B gets the chance to play another move [elsewhere\].  Although by capturing this B stone W could gain thickness, but comparing with B [O2\] and W [N4\] variation mentioned earlier [B[a\]-W[25\] at node #25\], it's actually a one-move difference, and this difference is quite big.

W #28 this move ---

[*** 'B' to see a reference.\]]
(;L[bd]B[dj]C[B #29 to play at [a\] is also a good point.

B #29 not only breaks the ladder, but it's also a big fuseki point.

[*** 'B' and 'C' to see the variations.\]]
(;W[lp]C[W #30 of course.];L[bd][ef]B[dn]C[If B #31 plays at [a\] ([B16\]), after W[b\], *then* B plays #31 [D6\] -- if so, W[a\]-B[b\] exchange simplifies the situation, and it's in favor of B.

However, W would not play this way W[b\] vs. B[a\].

[*** 'B' to see a reference.\]]
(;L[ef][bd]M[dj][dn]W[fd]C[If W #32 plays at [a\], B[b\] and it's again the ideal picture for 
B shown previously.

Also ---

[*** 'B' to see another variation.\]

Now back to the game -- when there are those two marked B stones, 
W #32 is normally considered too strong.  The reason W plays so is because he has spent two moves to capture [N4\] stone, so W is now trying to utilize this thickness.

Since W has invested for thickness, he now will have to make most out of this investment so that he will have the advantage in future battles.  This is certainly expected.]
(;L[gc]B[gd]C[B #33 absolutely cannot give in to play [a\] ([G17\]).  B #33 hane is called "great avalanche" joseki.]
;W[cc];B[bd];W[cb]C[W #34 to #36 are certain.

Next move ---

[*** 'B' to see a variation for B #37.\]]
(;M[dj]B[bc]C[Since the normal [traditional\] way doesn't seem ideal, I thought of #37 to bend inward.  This was a move that I had studied before.  Even without [D10\] stone [marked\], this [#37\] would be a powerful move.

"Great avalanche" joseki had been used since 20 years ago [20 years before 1957\].  Why had professional players never found this move [#37 bending inward\]?  I think the reason was that the shape of this move didn't look good, thus it was overlooked, becoming a blind spot.

[*** 'B-E' to see 4 reference diagrams on "great avalanche" joseki.\]]
(;W[bb];B[be]C[(* On first look, #37 this move is plain ordinary, but the strategy it implies is totally different from the old joseki in which B sacrifices three stones. This is the fundamental difference between the two [josekis\]. *)]
;W[gc];B[hc]C[(* Two days after 吴清源 9-dan played this new variation, 坂田荣男 9-dan immediately applied this move in NHK sponsored lightning games, even astonishing his opponent Shimamura 8-dan.

(* #37 this new move shocked the Go world.

(* Hasegawa 8-dan published an article, "My Study Notes", on "Igo" magazine (1957.5).  In the article, he studied this new move.

(* 前田陈尔 9-dan carefully explained the development of "great avalanche" joseki in an article "The Changes in a Joseki." In the article, he especially mentioned this new move by 吴清源. *)]
;W[gb];B[fb]C[(* Would this joseki [after the change\] be widely used afterwards?  If "great avalanche" joseki thereafter disappeared in the games, then it would mean that people had the conclusion\: #37 was indeed a great move [for B\], and it led good results for B. If a variation is only favorable to one side, then it cannot be joseki, and it would certainly disappear in the games. *)]
;W[hb];L[ab][ca]B[db]C[B #45 blocks, and the three W stones at the corner are captured.

Next, even if W[a\], B[b\] and B wins the semeai by one liberty.]
;L[ic]W[ea]C[W #46 to play [a\] ([J17\]) hane directly is better.];L[cf][ab][ca]
B[da]C[After W #46 and B #47 exchange, W[a\] is no longer sente.  That is to say, next even if B tenuki after W[a\], when W[b\], B[c\] and B still wins the semeai.

Without the above exchange [#46-#47\], however, when W[a\], if B tenuki ---

[*** 'B' to see a reference.\]]
(;L[cf]W[ic]C[W #48 certainly.  Since W[a\] is no longer sente, if W #48 plays 
at [a\], letting B play #48 [J17\], then W is not good.]
;L[hd]B[ge]C[W three stones' [D16-F16\] liberties are already tighten 
up, so B #49 to extend applies more pressure on W than simply to connect 
at [a\].

(* In some later games, B[a\] connecting also appeared.  However, 
probably because of poor results, such move was no longer played again. 
*)]
;L[df]W[ef]C[W #50 is the only move.

If #50 plays at [a\] ([D14\]), when B attaches at #50, W is collapsed. 
#50 point is the so-called "center of three stones"; it's the emergent 
point to both sides.]
;L[fg]B[cf]C[B #51 was also considered to play at [a\] to block W inside, 
but W #51 would live locally and even if B builds up thickness around 
this area, it would not be of much use, since W has thickness at lower 
right to balance out any B's thickness here.]
;L[eh][ee][df][fg]W[ff]C[W #52 is the only move.

If W[a\] jump instead, B[b\] and three W stones are captured; or if 
W[c\] for #52, this time B[d\] would force W in trouble.

How should B play the next move, #53?

[*** 'B' to see a variation.\]]
(;M[hc][gd][ge]B[gi]C[Therefore, B chooses an ogeima [big knight move\] for #53.

B #53's plan is to treat [marked\] three stones lightly -- sacrifice if necessary -- and emphasize on reducing W thickness at lower right.

Next W #54 ---

[*** 'B' to see a variation.\]]
(;W[fh];B[fi]C[W #54 [F12\] to exchange with B #55 is painful.  But as the 
variation [at node #53\] shown, W has no choice [since B can cut 
with [G14\]-[F13\]\].]
;W[hg]C[Next move, B #57 ---

[*** 'B' to see a variation.\]]
(;M[hc][gd][ge]B[lc]C[Therefore B decides to sacrifice three [marked\] stones and get some territory first.

Locally speaking, B loses by sacrificing three stones, and it's also unfavorable to let W settle, but what B gets in return is the simplification of the situation.]
;W[ie]C[When W #58 captures three B stones, sente now belongs to B. 
I think if B can get sente to occupy the big point at lower side, 
B is not dissatisfied.

(;B[ep]C[Hence B #59 attaches on W stone from outside, starting to 
reduce W moyo.

(;L[fp]W[eo]C[[Therefore,\] W #70 is the right move at the right time.

Next if B[a\] to extend, what would be the result?

[*** 'B' to see this variation.\]]
(;B[hq]C[Based on the above reason [shown in variation at node #70\], 
B to activate one stone [E4\] immediately is not good.  Therefore, 
B turns to play #71 keima.]
;L[fp][bn]W[cm]C[W #72 normally plays W[a\] to eat one B stone.  But in this case, 
B would certainly play [b\] to fence the territory at left side.  Playing 
this way W[a\] would be weak and conservative.]
;L[qh][oi][cg]B[fp]C[B #73 to play at [a\] ([R12\]) is also very big.  Next if W #73 [F4\] to take one B stone, B[b\] to expand the upper right corner. However, currently the connection among B stones on the left side is not solid -- for example, W[c\] would weaken the three B stones in the center -- So B #73 chooses to get the two W stones.]
;W[qf]C[W #74 is the last big point on the board.

(* This game was the first game in history in which the "bending 
inward" variation of "great avalanche" joseki was played.  This revolutionary joseki had its significance in the development of Go, therefore this is a memorable game. *)]

;B[ld]C[(* But as mentioned before, if it's only in favor of one side, it would not be called a joseki. Indeed, thereafter people playing W started to avoid this joseki, and it could not be used again. A joseki once was so popular, it eventually disappeared [for a while\]
