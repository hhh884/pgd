;B[pe]C[This is my first encounter with Fujisawa 9 dan after the 10-game series 4 years ago [1953; the 3rd Wu-Fujisawa 10-game series\].

Fujisawa 9-dan deliberates on every move; never hasty.  His steady and thick style has well settled in the Go world.

B #1 takamoku [(4,5) point at the corner\] is rarely seen in Fujisawa 9-dan's game.  It's probably a personal interest intriguered by a recent game of mine.  This will be explained a little bit later.  ]
;W[qp]C[(* Fujisawa 9-dan's original given name was Kuranosuke, later changed to Hosai.  In his early years, as one of the strongest young players, he was regarded as unbeatable playing Black.  He was also the first player promoted to 9-dan after ±æ“Ú∑ª–„‘’ [the last Meijin\].  In 1943, as a 6-dan, he played Œ‚«Â‘¥ (then 8-dan) a 10-game series in which he played all games with Black.  Fujisawa won the series 6-4.  Then in 1951, a 4-game series with Wu (Wu won all four).  In 1952, a 6-game series (Wu 5-1) and the second Wu-Fujisawa 10-game series (Wu 5-2-1 with 1 tie).  Finally in 1953, the third Wu-Fujisawa 10-game series, which ended after Wu led 5-1.
nst €‡ÃÔ»Ÿƒ–.  Fujisawa played White and adopted a move-imitating strategy, but lost at the end to Sakata.  This game here is the second by Fujisawa after his name change.]
;B[do]C[B #1 and #3 occupying takamoku points at diagonal corners is the opening ¡Âƒæ‘Ω–€ 7-dan used in a game versus me.  Fujisawa 9-dan was then the referee, and he watched the game from the beginning to the end.  That game was won by Black.  Perhaps Fujisawa 9-dan learned some winning strategy from the game, and here he applies the same "diagonal takamoku" opening.]
;W[cd]C[W #2 and #4 play komoku [(3,4) point at the corner\], choosing a most common opening strategy.  So far it's exactly the same as the game between Suzuki and me mentioned before.  To resemble kendo [Japanese fencing\], B raises his sword way above his head, ready to cut down, while W levels his sword, pointing to opponent's throat.]
;L[po]B[pc]C[In the game mentioned before, Suzuki 7-dan suddenly played B #5 at [a\], an unexpected odd move.  I guess Fujisawa 9-dan probably would not use such a novel move against me.  However it was not impossible, but I was ready.  In fact, even if Ba, there is nothing to be afraid of.

(* Indeed, B didn't play [a\], but #5, a common play, instead *)]
;W[dq]C[W #6 [D3\] is the normal way against takamoku [(4,5) point\].  Also, allowing B to have shimari [corner enclosure move\] at both corners would be disadvantageous to W in an opening.  Therefore, #6 is also absolutely the move.]
;B[fp]C[B #7 is a basic joseki.

Fujisawa 9-dan used this move when he played 10-game series with me, and he had used it before that.  Also, he chose this joseki in Mainichi Shimbon sponsored Honinbo Sen.  This is a shape he likes.

If W plays here right away ---

(;W[fc]C[Anyways, if W acts at lower left right away, immidate fights are almost certain to follow [as the variations show\], so I adopted tenuki [ignoring lower left\], and turned to upper left.  W #8 shimari [enclose corner\].]
;B[er]C[B #9 is a joseki move.  This move ---

(;W[bo]C[[Conclusion on variations of W #10\] When B #9 [E2\], W can live simply with [D2\] block.  However, if W just attempts to live here, it's definitely not the best strategy.

W #10 [B5\], a "quick shift" strategy, is also a joseki.  This is a strategy I like.  I have used it many times before; it's a light way to play.]
;B[cp]C[B #11 of course.  If ---

[*** 'B' to see a variation.\]]
(;M[bo]W[cl]C[W #12 [C8\] and #10 [B5\] are related moves.  The goal is to sacrifice [D3\] stone, forming a moyo at the left side.]
;L[kc]B[oq]C[B #13 gets the biggest point on the board.

If this move to play at [a\], it's also big, but #13 kakari is urgent.]
;L[lq]W[lp]C[W #14 could also consider to play at [a\].  It's difficult to say which one is better.

If [a\] for W #14, it would become a different game.]
;L[np]B[on]C[B #15 joseki.

If B[a\] kosumi, it's also a joseki, and it's a solid way to play.


[*** 'B' to see this joseki.\]]
(;L[oo]W[qm]C[W #16 is joseki.

W[a\] is also a move ---

[*** 'B' to see this variation.\]

But as a result [of this variation\], this part is almost settled, and W should not be satisfied.]
(;M[lp]B[jp]C[B #17 good point.

(* Since W [M4\] is "high" [at line 4\], B #17 also plays high to squeeze [M4\] stone. *)

Besides #17, there are several other big points on the board, but #17 is the most urgetn.

Next move W #18 is a difficult point of this opening, it's also a key to decide the outcome of the game.

Under this situation, most common plays [for W #18\] are ---

[*** 'B' and 'C' to see variations.\]]
(;W[op]C[This move, W #18, is still better off to adopt the plays shown in variations 1 and 2.  W #18 led extremely unfavorable influence [to W\] later in the game.  This is the intersection point of the opening, and based on the result, this move [W #18\] is very bad.]
;L[pp]B[np]C[B #19 certainly.

[*** 'B' to see this variation.\]]
(;L[oo]W[no]C[W #20 is the only move, and it's a subsequential move following #18 [P4\].

W[a\] instead would be mediocre.

Next, how should B #21 respond?  Let's take a look.

[*** 'B' and 'C' to see referneces.\]]
(;B[pp]C[Therefore, B #21 [Q4\] to atari from this side is a good move.];W[oo]C[W of course #22 connects.]
;B[po]C[B #23 is also the only move.];L[nq]W[pq]C[W #24 can only cut from here.  If W cuts from [a\] ---

[*** 'B' to see a short variation.\]]
(;L[mo]B[qq]C[If B #25 plays at [a\], the ladder wouldn't work, and B would be in serious trouble.]
;W[pr];B[qo]C[These couple of moves are certain; no variations.];W[nq];L[qk][qi]
B[pm]C[To B #29, it's a settled shape.

Although locally speaking, it looks like a "fair trade." But B #29 has a perfect distance from the shimari at upper right corner.  Counting this, W is at the lower hand.

Next if W[a\] jumps, B[b\] is a good point; or if W[b\], then B[a\] is a good point.

In short, this unfavorable result is caused by the "improper taste" of W #18 and #20 [P4-O5\].]
;L[qk][ql]W[pl]C[W #30 is still better to jump at [a\] [despite the fact that, pointed out previously, B [R11\] would be a good point\].

Now, if B[b\] cut ---

[*** 'B' to see this variation.\]]
(;B[ol];W[pk];B[qi]C[B #33 is still an extremely good point.  Next B[a\] is severe.  W is indeed difficult now.

(;L[kc]B[ok]C[B #35 is thick.  This move to play at [a\] is a big point, but then W would get [P9\], aiming next at [b\] invasion.

B #35 fully exhibits Fujisawa 9-dan's thick and solid style.]
;L[ri][jd]W[kc]C[If W #36 plays [a\], it would be a good point too.  Then B would get [b\] for sure.  Hard to say which one is better.]
;B[qj]C[B #37 rush is a common method to test opponent's response.

If W #38 blocks at [R9\] ---

[*** 'B' to see this variation.\]]
(;L[qk][rl][rm]W[rk]C[If W #38 plays at [a\], B would have [b\], and when W *then* plays [S9\], B[c\] would deprive the eyeshape from W; W would be under attack.]
;B[cj]C[B #39 turns to invade the left side.  Extremely good timing.  Next B aims to play [C13\], at the meantime threatens to attack two W stones [C8-B5\] below. ]
;W[bp]C[If W #40 plays directly at [C12\], B would certainly block at [B4\].  W #40 to extend is also a big move regarding to territory.  W cannot miss it.]
;B[cq]C[B of course plays #41.];L[cg]W[ch]C[W #42 too is certainly the move. To let B play [a\] would be unbearable.

(* W #42 forms a squeeze attack against one B stone [C10\].  What should B play next? *)

[*** 'B' to see a variation for B's next move, #43\]]
(;B[dn];L[cm][dk][el][bn]W[dm]C[W #44 is not a good-taste move, but there is no other better moves.  If played at [a\], B[b\] and W is sealed inside.

Also, if W #44 plays [c\] jump, it would leave B a move at [d\] to capture two W stones.  This way, W losses territory.]
;L[ej]B[dk]C[B[a\] instead of #45 is lack of pressure on W.];W[dl]C[W #46 forms a bad shape.  But again, W has no other choices.]
;B[fk];W[bq]C[If W doesn't play #48 now, and let B to play here, not only B would remove W's base, B also gains territory.  Very big.]
;L[ri]B[rm]C[B #49 tsuke [squeeze move\] to deprive the eyeshape of W, thus forcing W to escape, is indeed a severe tesuji, although B[a\] can also be considered.  After that ---

C[W #94 has three purposes.  First is to attack three B stones [D9\]; second prepare to break the ladder when W[a\] (Although right now it doesn't break the ladder, but W can employ #94 as a base, using the ladder fact, to establish a fighting plan); third is to aim at [b\] invasion.

;L[le][lf][ld]B[ke]C[B #95 should play B[a\], since if B[a\], W cannot [L15\] -- B would have [b\] against W [L15\], and W's weakness is exposed.

Anyway, as soon as W is separated by B #95, W's middle team becomes thin, and W's plan of #94 [F7\] to attack three B stones is out of reach.  Therefore, as said previously, W [#94\] should play [c\] to protect.]

;W[kp];B[kq];W[jo];B[ip];W[io]C[(Overview) Looking back the game, at the opening period, because of some inappropraite personal inclinations in #18 and #20, when B #29, it was not optimistic for W.  Then a fight initiated by W #30 made own [W\] stones heavy.  As a result, W was attacked severely and cleverly. (To be continued)]
;B[hp];W[eg]C[(Overview; continued) Since #68 cut, W looked for chances to maneuver over the upper right corner, hoping to settle a team at the right side.  During this complicated conflict, although W achieved the goal to get rid of the trouble, but then #94 was played at wrong direction, thus B #95 started another violent fight. (To be continued)]
;B[gg];W[br];B[pi]C[(Overview; continued) W attempted to counter B's violent attack and rushed with #136.  This move was a serious mistake, led to B's sente attacks -- W fell to being one-sided attacked.  Although W tried to counterattack, but never got the chance. (To be continued)]
;W[oi];B[nn];W[mo];B[mr]C[(Overview; continued) The battle continued to #154, finally making a ko.  This ko was very easy to B, since win or loss [of this ko\] wouldn't effect B's being leading.  But it was on the other hand a huge, live-or-die ko to W.  With such a difference in lightness and heaviness, B eventually calmly played #155, filling up the holes at upper right corner. (To be continued)]
;W[ln];B[bh]C[(Overview; continued) W #156 was the final struggle.  Since #157's response was inproper, the nature of the ko changed.  W suddenly saw a hope to turn it around, being obviously down.  Unfortunately, W #162 was less careful, finding a ko threat that was too small.  When B #163 finished the ko, the outcome was then decided. [End of overview by Wu.\]]
