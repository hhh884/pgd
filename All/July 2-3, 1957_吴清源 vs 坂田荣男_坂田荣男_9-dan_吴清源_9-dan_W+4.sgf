;B[qd]C[(* In these matches [1st Japan's Strongest Deciding Matches\], 吴清源 9-dan and Sakata 9-dan played a total of two games.  The result of the first game [posted as Game 3 of the 吴清源 series\] was that 吴清源 won by resignation on B.  This game was the second match between the two; Wu played W. *)]
;W[dc]C[(* At the beginning [of this game\], in an avalanche joseki at the lower right corner, 吴清源 9-dan's W #24 should have captured a stone cleanly [according to the joseki\], but to lure B to extend out [the stone under atari\], W chose to play a move at lower left corner instead.  This unusual move, as an interesting inclination, certainly contained its speical understanding of the game, but it eventually brought W unfavorable results.  Thereafter, Sakata 9-dan [B\] gained with move after move, and to the middle game stage, B grabbed the lead. *)]
;B[pq]C[(Overview continued)
(* From then on, Wu fought hard all over the board.  Gradually he pulled it even, and the outcome of the game became uncertain.  But then, because of W #132 and #134's mistakes, B made an extraordinary move in W's territory, and B grabbed the lead again.  吴清源 9-dan then started a ko to struggle, and it turned out to be a favorable exchange for W.  The situation thus turned sharply, and this time W had the lead.  Finally, a big B team was invovled in a ko fight --- this was almost a free ko to W and B was therefore already in disadvantage, but B even decided to ignore the ko fight and jumped into endgame after tenuki.  This ko would directly decide the game, and with even one more ko threat, W would force B to a state of despair.  It became extremely tensive and violent on the board.  At the end, since B was under time pressure and he had no time to do the most careful calculation, B lost points during the ko fight, and B ended up losing by 4 points. *)]
;W[dq]C[(* This game was full of violent and nerve-straining fights.  Both sides spent a great amount of energy and brain cells.  Reflecting onto the board, it was a seesaw game from the beginning to the end.  This was indeed a rare masterpiece. *)]
;B[oc]C[(* In 吴清源 9-dan's games, there were almost always ko fights.  He often said, "Mr. Such-and-such really like to fight ko." --- Although in fact he didn't dislike ko fights himself. *)]
;L[qn][qo][qk]W[po]C[W #6 this move is often played at [a\] after the War.

(* If W #6 simply kakari at [b\] instead of [a\], then B's next move would certainly be at [c\], a move implies both a pincer and an extension.  Therefore, W almost never plays [b\] anymore. *)]
;B[qo];W[pp]C[(* W #8 is the avalanche joseki. Next up to #10 is the certain consequence after this move [#8\]. *)]
;B[qp];L[qn][qq][or][pn]W[oq]C[Next move (B #11) is the splitting point of the variations of avalanche joseki.  B has [a\] to extend, [b\] to connect, [c\] to double hane, or [d\] to hane from the other side.]
;B[pn]C[This variation of B #11 hane is called "small avalanche" joseki. Comparing with other avalanche josekis, this one has less variations.]
;W[qq]C[W #12 cuts...];B[pr];W[rq]C[To W #14 extends.  This is the only sequence.]
;B[or];W[np];B[nq];W[qn]C[(* If W #18 connects at [P4\] --- *)

(;B[op];W[oo];B[no];W[on];B[mp]C[(* To B #23, it's the joseki that everyone is familiar with. *)]
;L[pm][nm]W[do]C[W #24's normal play [joseki\] is to capture a stone at [a\].  But if so, B would get the sente, leaving a possible jump of B[b\]. Therefore, many people believe this shape [after W[a\]\] is B's thickness.  Besides, under the current situation, if W #24 captures a stone, B would certainly gets #24 [D5\] for a kakari move.  Next ---

[*** 'B' to see a reference.\]]
(;B[de];L[co][dd][cd][ec]W[ce]C[Had W [D5\] shimari [enclosure move\] at [a\], when W #26, B probably would choose to play B[b\]-W[c\]-B[d\] to form an avalanche shape.  But now the shimari at lower left corner is a one-space jump, therefore ---]
;B[cf]C[B chooses #27 and...];W[cd];L[cl][co]B[dg]C[[And\] #29.  Thus, a big extension to [a\] by B next would be a good move, since the shape of W's present enclosure at lower left leaves openings at the bottom, and B would be able to invade.  However, had W's [D5\] move played at [b\], B[a\] extension would not be so good.  B #27 didn't go for an avalanche joseki, it was probably because of this thinking.]
;W[ef];B[df];W[ed];B[cl]C[B #33 good move, and it's B's plan.

B #33 sometimes adopts the following variation ---

[*** 'B' and 'C' to see it.\]]
(;L[ck][bo]W[ee]C[B occupies the good point of #33 [C8\], but W too gets a thick shape by #34 connecting.

In the previous diagram, B #33 to extend to [a\] is joseki.  But the actual extension of #33 also aims at a subsequent ogeima B[b\] to invade the corner.  From this point of view, the distance between #33 and [b\] is appropriate.  If B tries to extend to [b\] from [a\] instead, there is a danger that W might counterattack with #33 [C8\], an attachment on B[a\] stone.]
;L[cj]B[eg]C[B #35 has no choice.  Since B's extension [to C8\] is one space too far [comparing with joseki\], W is able to invade at [a\].  B #35 prevents this invasion.]
;L[cj]W[cn]C[[But,\] After W #36 kosumi, W [again\] has [a\] to invade.

[*** 'B' to see a reference.\]]
(;B[el]C[Therefore, B #37 jumps to defend one move.];L[jd][fg][fh][gh]W[kd]C[W #38 is the big point of fuseki.  The three W stones at the left serves as a thick wall, and that's why W could extend as far as #38.  If W tenuki here, and let B extend to [a\], the difference would be huge.  After this wide extension of #38, next W[b\] hane, when B[c\], W[d\] hane again would be severe.]
;B[gg];L[bk][ej]W[cj]C[W #40 invade to observe B's reaction.

[*** 'B' to see a possible variation for B's next move.\]

Or if B[a\] kosumi next, W[b\] jumps and B cannot capture W stones.]
(;B[dk]C[When B #41...];L[gi][fk]W[bm]C[W #42 is sente to benefit.

In the future, W still can take advantage [of [C10\] stone\] to play [a\] or [b\]; the invaded one W stone [C10\] is not so easily swallowed by B.

After B already fence up a territory, W still have various ways to invade.  One should master this method.]
;B[bl];L[pm]W[ph]C[W #44's purpose is to lure B [Q6\] stone to extend out.  However, this move (#44) should still correctly play at [a\].  [Suppose\] After W #44 captures one stone ---

[*** 'B' to see this reference.\]]
(;B[pm]C[B #45 to extend is of course what W expected.  However, as soon as B made this move, W shape unexpectedly became thin.

Next W #46 ---

[*** 'B' to see a variation.\]]
(;W[ro];B[qm];L[rn]W[rp]C[If W #48 connects at [a\], B would be able to force again from above.  To be forced by B in sente in consecutive moves this way would be unbearable, therefore W #48 has to capture.]
;B[rn];W[pk]C[W #50 ---

[*** 'B' to see a variation.\]]
(;B[ol];L[ok]W[nn]C[W #52's purpose is to hope B would press at [a\] ---

[*** 'B' to see this variation of B's next move.\]]
(;B[qf]C[B #53 good move.  What should W do next?  It's indeed difficult for W now.]
;W[qg]C[W #54 and...];B[pf];W[rl]C[[And\] #56's shape is thin, but W has no other choices.  W's only strategy here is defense.

In short, after B #45 [Q7\] extended out, W didn't gain any satisfactory result in this local conflict.  Looking back, this is the fault of an inappropriate inclination in W #44 [Q12\].]
;B[ok];W[pj];B[mk]C[B #59 is certainly the move.  If B tenuki here, and when W attacks from #59, B would be immediately in trouble.]
;W[lo];L[oh][nh]B[oi]C[B #61 good move; thick.  Next if W[a\], B[b\] hane.  B's upper part is solid, and going out toward [opponent's\] solid zone is hopeless.]
;L[id]W[hf]C[If W #62 is omitted, B[a\] invasion would be quite severe.

[*** 'B' and 'C' to see two other varations of #62.\]]
(;B[kb]C[B #63 of course.

Since W has already fenced a move at a high point [H14\], the lower side would certainly be invaded.  W really cannot help.]
;L[ei]W[fk]C[W #64 is the tesuji move aimed at since long ago.  Next W prepares to play [a\] to save a stone.]
;B[fl];W[hk];L[oh][ei]B[gl]C[B #67 to play at [a\] ([P12\]) is also a thick move, but W would certainly play #67 [G8\], and next W[b\] to save one stone is even more severe.

It's difficult to say which move is better, #67 or [a\].]
;L[oh]W[oj]C[W #68 to go out at [a\] directly would be awkward, and the reason was explained earlier. [That is, if W[a\], B would hane to force W move toward the upper side, where B is very solid.\]]
;B[nj];W[ni]C[W has no other way but to push and cut and fight with #68 [P10\] and #70 [O11\].

Next B #71 ---

[*** 'B' to see a variation.\]]
(;B[mi]C[B #71 was the seal move at the end of first day.

B #71 atari, sacrificing one stone [P11\]...]
;W[nh];B[ic]C[Then B #73 keima to invade W's territory, gaining some profeit first.  At this point, B already leads on territory, so he avoids complicated fights like the one shown in the variation [at node 70\].  Clearly, this is a wise choice.

To summerize the process up to B #73\: W #44 did not capture a stone cleanly, and after B #45 extended out, W's working space became narrow, and his activities were thus limited.  During the conflicts that followed, W was unable to make a comfortable path, and B finally grabbed the upper hand, invading into W's upper side, establishing a winning form.]
;W[nc]C[W cannot hope to make territory at the lower side, so W's only move is to attach with #74, seperating B groups for a deciding fight!]

Therefore, W has to play #82, running for life.]
(;L[mf][lh][lg][kg]B[le]C[When B #83, if W extends to [a\] next, after B[b\]-W[c\]-B[d\], B connects easily.

The big B team from the right side to the middle is not completely settled yet.  If W loses the chances to attack this big dragon of B, W would lose the chance to win the game as well.  Therefore, W's top priority now is to separate this B team from the B stones at the top.]
