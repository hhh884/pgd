;B[qd]C[When B #1...];W[oc]C[W #2 immediately approaches.  W does so not only to prevent a solid shimari [corner enclosure\] by B, but more importantly is to first observe B's response.]
;L[ec]B[dc]C[B #3 traditionally is played at [a\], which is regarded as common sense, but B #3 to get komoku [3-4 point\] is also valid.]
;L[de]W[ce]C[W #4 again kakari [cornre approach\].  This move is to prevent B[a\] shimari.]
;L[cp][co][do]B[dp]C[B #5 certainly plays this direction.  Also, this move at [a\], [b\], or [c\] is also valid.]
;L[qp]W[oq]C[W #6's purpose is to prevent B from approaching at the low position point [a\], since the B stone at upper right corner is already low [line 3\].]
;L[dh][ci][dg]B[ch]C[B #7 can also pincer at [a\], [b\], or [c\]; any of these moves works.

;B[ec]C[B #13 ---

[*** 'B' to see a variation.\]]
(;W[di]C[W #14 is a joseki shape.

(* This form seems not finally settled yet, so it can be seen as an unfinished joseki. *)]
;L[cj][ci]B[df]C[B #15 to jump at [a\] or extend to [b\] is joseki, but when B[a\] ---

(;W[ef]C[B #15 [D14\] to exchange with W #16 is a variation never seen in this joseki before, but under the current situation, this exchange is efficient.  The reason will be explained later.

(;B[ci];W[dj];B[cj];W[dk];B[cl]C[To here, if W tenuki [ignore and play elsewhere\] ---

(* How professionals deeply deliberate for gaining a sente is worth our studying and understanding.*)

(* B #15 this new variation of joseki will probably be widely used hereafter. *)]
(;B[dl]C[After obtaining the sente, B #23 pushes, and this is the key point on the whole board.  Next move (W #24) is difficult.

[*** 'B' to see a variation.\]]
(;W[cq]C[Based on the above reasoning, W #24 therefore invades 3-3 immediately.  This is a move by Hashimoto 9-dan after a deep thinking.

[*** 'B' and 'C' to see the references.\]]
(;L[cp]B[dq]C[If B #25 blocks at [a\], the space above would be too narrow; not good.]
;W[cp];M[cl][dl]B[cr]C[When there are [C8-D8\] stones [marked\], B #27 hane [and next after W [B2\], #29 connecting at [D2\]\] from this side is common sense.  In this game, however ---

(;W[br];B[dr];L[dn]W[cn]C[After W #30 jumps, B feels unexpectedly difficult.

At this moment, B[a\] is the shape, but ---

(;L[jp][bo]B[en]C[B #31's shape is thin.  But to get sente to play [a\], B has no other choice.

(* If W tenuki here, B[b\] and W dies. *)]
;W[bm]C[Now W is forced to live in gote.];B[bl];W[bo];B[jp]C[And B gets to play this big fuseki point.  Although B achieves this goal, but B's overall shape is thin, therefore the variation shown previously [at node #27\] is better.]
;W[el]C[W #36 is correct.  This move ---

[*** 'B' to see a variation.\]]
(;B[em];L[dm][bb][bc][bd][cd][ac]W[fl]C[W #38 is aiming at [a\] cut, and at the same time, it prepares for a chance to start a ko fight at upper left corner with W[b\]-B[c\]-W[d\]-B[e\].

If W wins this ko, after W[f\] to finish the ko, W[a\] cut would become extremely powerful.  But now there is no appropriate ko threat, so starting the ko fight is still early.

The importance of [a\] cut is ---

(;B[bs];W[ar];B[gm]C[(* B #41 jumps.  On one hand it strengthens the lower side, on the other hand it advances to the center. *)]

[*** 'B' to see a reference.\]]
(;B[od]C[[But,\] B unexpectedly presses a W stone [instead of the kosumi variation shown previously\], and this does not follow W's plan.

(;W[pd]C[Therefore W #44 wedging in is the only move.

Next if B ---

(;B[pe]C[But, after #45 [indeed\] atari...];W[pc];L[qb]B[qc]C[B has this variation for #47 [it was [O16\] in the variation shown previously\].  I think this is a powerful tactic.

;B[qh]C[B #61 has no other choice.];L[bb]W[id]C[W #62 this move ---

[*** 'B' and 'C' to see two references.\]

W of course has read out the above variations, and W is not going to make any haste actions. #62, therefore, invades.

W hopes to start a ko fight at upper left (at [a\]), and is waiting for chances.]
(;L[le][kd][ld][lg][qj]B[mf]C[On first look, B[a\] is the shape for B.  But if so, W[b\] immediately peeps --- when B[c\] connects, W[d\] boshi [cap\].  As soon as W gets [d\], W[e\] would be severe now.  This way, B[a\] clearly becomes a bad move.  In actual play, B #63 [N14\] to press the four W stones is appropriate.]
;W[pj]C[W #64 ---

[*** 'B' to see a variation.\]]
(;B[qj];L[qk]W[pk]C[If W #66 to play [a\] hane instead, B would cut at #66 [Q9\] right away --- W[a\] would be an overplay.

(* Both 桥本宇太郎 9-dan and 吴清源 9-dan were disciples of 濑越宪作 9-dan.  Hashimoto was in fact Wu's elder study-mate.  Before 吴清源's move to Japan, 井上孝平 5-dan had discovered Wu's genius when he visited China.  In 1928, when 桥本宇太郎 visited China, he played 吴清源 (then 14) two games.  Wu took black (H-1) and won both -- those were the first matches between the two; Hashimoto was 4-dan at that time.  After WWII, they played each other many times.  For example the 1946 Wu-Hashimoto 10-game series; 1950 Wu-Hashimoto 3-game series; 1950 Wu-Hashimoto 10-game series; 1957 the First Japan's Strongest Deciding Matches; 1958 the Second Japan's Strongest Deciding Matches; 1959 the Third Japan's Strongest Deciding Matches; and 1961 the First Meijin Sen; etc.  吴清源 beat all the top players in 10-game series, as mentioned before, and the first 10-game series of such was started between Wu and Hashimoto. *)]
;B[pi]C[(* B #67 a "hanging connection" to... *)];W[oi]C[(* [To\] force W #68 to block is to take into account the fact that a ladder would work for B. *)]
;B[oj]C[When B #69 cuts ---

[*** 'B' to see a variation for W's next move.\]]
(;W[ni];B[rl]C[B #71 this move is aiming at ---

[*** 'B' to see a reference.\]]
(;L[bb]W[kb]C[W #72 is a difficult move.

[*** 'B' to see a variation.\]

[Indeed,\] based on the current positions, although W is thick, B is far ahead on territory.

W also realizes that the chance to form territory at the center is uncertainly, so he chooses to play #72, on one hand keeping a pressure on B team, while on the other hand waiting for a chance to play [a\], using a ko fight to struggle.  This strategy itself was not wrong, but based on the later result, this #72 is questionable.]
(;L[kc][kd]B[ib]C[B #73 is tesuji.  Next if W[a\], B[b\] hane and W is collapsed.  Also ---

[*** 'B' and 'C' to see the variations.\]]
(;W[jb];B[jd]C[B #75 is another blow right at W's weak spot.

This move ---

[*** 'B' to see a variation.\]

How will W handle B #75 with his next move (W #76)? ---

[*** 'C' to see a variation.\]]
(;W[ic]C[Based on the above reasons, W #76 and...];B[hb];W[jc]C[[...And\] #78 are not what W likes but he has no other choices.]
;M[kb]B[je]C[As a result, W [L18\] stone becomes a bad shape.  The result of a bad W stone [L18\] is caused by the strong B tesujis of #73 and #75, and these two tesuji moves were led by W #72.  When I previously said W #72 was questionable, the reason is shown here.]
;W[gc];L[bb]B[gb]C[Earlier, W[a\] to start a ko had always been a threat to B's eyeshape, and B had to worry about it from time to time.  But as soon as B gets #81, a ko started by W [at [a\]\] is not serious anymore.]
;W[ie]C[To here, #82 to escape is the only way W could choose.];L[nk]B[jg]C[B #83 jumps out.  B's pace is easy and smooth.

[Also,\] W would have to play [a\] geta sooner or later; this is always a burden to W.]
;W[nk]C[W #84 ---

[*** 'B' to see a variation.\]

In short, if W #84 doesn't capture one B stone first, it would be difficult for W to take any actions [elsewhere\].]
(;B[if]C[B #85.  Normally, W would be in great danger and pain after such a hane move by B.  In this picture, however, W has tesuji to connect at the upper edge in case of emergency.]
;W[ld]C[W #86 and...];B[kc];W[kd]C[[...And\] #88 are the tesuji moves to connect along the upper edge.

Next move ---

[*** 'B' to see a variation for B #89.\]]
(;B[me]C[Therefore B #89 has no choice.];W[ma];B[mc]C[B #91 is also the only move.

To here, W [team at upper middle\] could either escape to the outside or connect from below [at the *upper* edge \:-)\]; W has two ways to withstand any danger.  Therefore, naturally, W could tenuki now.]
;W[qf];B[qe];W[qg]C[(* W #92 [R14\] and #94 gain in sente, leaving a big sente endgame move at the corner as well. *)]
;B[rg];W[rc];L[rd][re]B[se]C[#97 is the best response to save eyeshape. (For example, if W[a\], B[b\] ensures a whole eye to the right.)]
;L[kf][jf][lf]W[lh]C[W #98 is aiming at W[a\]-B[b\]-W[c\] to save two stones.];B[kh]
C[B #99, however, eliminate this W plan.];W[lg];L[qp]B[kf]C[After B #101 defends, how W should plan for the future battles is rather a difficult question for W.  W is in trouble, needless to say.

If W thinks in the ordinary way that it's time to get the next big point on the board, then W should enclose the lower right corner at [a\].  However, if W adopts this ordinary move ---

[*** 'B' to see this variation.\]]
(;L[bb]W[fj]C[After a long deliberation, W decided on #102.  This seems to be a defensive move, but in fact it's also aiming at B's weak spots.  First, it still threatens W[a\] to start a ko at upper left corner.  Secondly, it aims at an invation to the lower side.  And third, it's also eyeing at the central B team.  It's indeed a scary move.

Under the current situation, how should B respond?]
;L[lq][kq][lp][jn]B[qp]C[B chooses to play #103.

This move ---

[*** 'B' to see a variation.\]

Later, if W[a\], B[b\] forces W[c\], and B gets the chance to fence at [d\].]
(;W[hp]C[#104 was the point W already aimed at when W played #102 [F10\].  This is a do-or-die move.]
;B[io];W[fq]C[Next move (B #107) ---

[*** 'B' to see a variation.\]]
(;L[dm]B[iq]C[Clearly, W has aimed at W[a\] cut since long ago, but B has other good choice but to go for the fight with #107 kosumi.]
;W[fo];B[eo];W[gn]C[(* W #110 kosumi-tsuke, and W seems to be escaping.  At this moment, if B is a little bit careless, he could fall into W's trap. *)]
;L[dm][an]B[am]C[B #111 is a good move.  This move ---

[*** 'B' to see a variation.\]

The reason that #111 is a good move is that it restrains W from cutting at [a\].

[*** 'C' to see a variation.\]]
(;W[do]C[Considering the serious result brought by the variation shown above [variation at the previous node\], W decides to avoid the ko and live here.

However, after B teams are connected, B doesn't have to worry about being attacked anymore.  In addition, B #119 connect is sente --- if W tenuki, B[a\] geta and this W team is captured.

;W[in]C[W #120 certainly.];B[mq]C[When B gets #121, he has gained back his loss [of territory at the left\] quite a bit.  Overall, B didn't lose much.
