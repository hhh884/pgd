;B[qd];W[pp]C[(* This game is played near some hot spring in Matsuyama, Shikoku [one of the main islands of Japan\].  Meanwhile, the game between Hashimoto Utaio 9-dan and Takagawa Honinbo is also played here.  The referee is ÃŸ‘Û≈Û’´ 9-dan.  Shikoku is a place where Go is very popular.  This time, the arrival of five 9-dans at the same time [should be four 9-dans; Takagawa is still 8-dan then\] is a rare chance for Go fans, thus the enthusiastic greetings from the fans are unprecedented. *)]
;L[dc]B[cd]C[B #3 to make a mukai komoku [B #1 and #3 two komoku stones are "facing" each other\] is the fuseki I have used quite often recently.  When I was 4 or 5-dan, I'd sometimes play at [a\].  This is only the difference in personal inclination.  Nothing deep.]
;L[oc][ed][jc][dq]W[ec]C[If W[a\] kakari from the other side, when B[b\] and W[c\], B would occupy [d\] at lower left.  In such an arrangement, W #4 is better than Wa.  This is a common sense in fuseki.

[*** 'B' to see a clear picture.\]]
(;B[oc]C[B #5 kogeima shimari [kogeima\: small knight move; shimari\: corner enclosure\] is the most solid shimari for B.]
;W[eq]C[Up to W #6, this opening also appeared in the games when I played —“±æﬁπ 8-dan and Takagawa Honinbo.  In thoes games, they played W too.

(* Before, in a game between Sakata 9-dan, W, and Takagawa Honinbo, the exactly same opening appeared too.  Perhaps because of this, in this game, both side spent little time to get to W #6. *)]
;L[gd]B[hd]C[B #7 to play [a\] for a one-space pincer can be also considered.  In a game between me and Takagawa Honinbo, I played this way [reference 1\], and Sakata 9-dan played this way [reference 2\] in Honinbo Sen.  In short, under this arrangement, there are various ways like one-space or two-space pincers.

[*** 'B' and 'C' to see references.\]]
(;W[ef];B[cg]C[W #8 and B #9 are the simplest joseki.];L[cp][qj]W[qi]C[W #10 is the biggest fuseki point.  Of course, W[a\] shimari [corner enclosure\] is also big, but under this situation, it's difficult for B to play kakari at [a\].

[*** 'B' to see why B[a\] at this point is not so good.\]

Besides, B[b\] at this point would be extremely good for B, and W #10 prevents that.  From this standpoint, W #10 indeed is the best point. ]
(;B[cq]C[Based on the reason described before [see reference diagram at W #10\], B #11 to approach at [C4\] is not very good, so B chooses [C3\] kakari.

(* Both [C3\] and [C4\] are "low approach", but the meaning is totally different. *)]
;W[do]C[W #12 certainly.];L[cn]B[co]C[Next W #14 to play W[a\] would not be good because ---

(;W[dn]C[Therefore, W #14 extend is the only move.];B[cn]C[(* And to extend here is also the only move for B. *)]
;M[cq]W[dm]C[To W #16, it's clear that B [C3\] stone has added a force at the corner, which is obviously better than [C4\].  That's why previously, B #11 played at [C3\] instead of [C4\].

(* After W #16, if B[a\], B's top and bottom stones would be all at low position.  Not good. *)]
;L[pn][kq][jp]B[nq]C[When B #17 kakari, W has various ways to respond, and the choice is difficult.

If W simply [a\] jumps, B would immediately [b\] or [c\] to extend.  If so, it would be a simple, easy game for B.

The purpose of this sequence [#18-#20\] is to prevent B from getting into the corner *and* from a pincer attack on B stones.  That is, W is trying to make moves on both sides.  This is a greedy way.]
;L[qo]B[po]C[B #21 is the urgent point.  Next if W[a\] hane ---

[*** 'B' to see this variation.\]]
(;W[oo]C[Perhaps W is not satisfied with the way shown in variation [at node #21\], so W #22 a strong hane, initiating a violent fight with B.

The reason that W plays such violently is because a ladder is good for W ---]
;B[op]C[W has already seen that if B #23...];W[pq]C[When W #24, next B (#25) cannot play at [a\] since the ladder doesn't work for B.  Therefore W chose [P5\] hane for #22.  From a strategical standpoint, since B gained at lower left corner, it's natural for W to force B to fight inside his [W's\] sphere of influence -- W hopes to gain in the process.]

;W[lr]C[W #64 is extremely big.  From the standpoint of profit, it's an anti-sente worth 6-7 points (Compare it with B sente hane here), and it has the purpose of taking away W's eyes and attacking W.  So it's a huge point.]

(;B[gp]C[This time, therefore, B #101 can only atari at [G4\].];W[hq]C[Then W #102 kosumi, and this W group's safety is no more a problem.

The fight at lower left corner draws to a temporary conclusion. Locally, W got the corner and gained, but to lose sente under current situation is questionable.

;B[rg]C[With sente, B gets to play #103 and...];W[rf];B[qh]C[...[and\] #105.  Not only a big gain on territory, but also deprived W's eyeshape, thus threatening to attack B.  B is able to get #103 and #105 -- although losing a bit at lower left corner, B should be satisfied.
