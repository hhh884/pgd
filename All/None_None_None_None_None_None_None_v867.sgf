;B[qd];W[dd]C[
Loking over Honinbo Shuei's games, we can find that he often played 
hoshi which favours a quick, large scale development. 
]
;B[pq];W[qo]C[
Although rare, even nowadays professionals sometimes ignore the 
empty corner for a while in the hopes of gasining an advantage elsewhere. 
Here White is trying to prevent a Black shimari. However.. 
]
;B[qk]C[
Considering the previous comment, Black should just tenuki and make 
the large shimari at "a". 
]
;W[nd];B[pf];M[nd][qo]W[co]C[
White moves to the open corner, treating the two moves \\t as light, 
preventing Black from making either shimari. 
]
;B[qp]C[
Black doesn't want to play at "a". 
];W[po];B[np];W[ok]C[
White can't invade because of the weakness of the stones below, 
so he plays lightly with 12. 
]
;B[pi];W[dq]C[
White has managed to make a shimari himself, while preventing Black 
from making a shimari in either corner. The game now seems tp revolve 
around how Black manages to worry White's weak stones on the right 
with an eye to limiting White's potential on the left. 
]
;B[lc]C[
If Black played 15 at "a".. 
];M[lc]W[gc]C[
White 16 and Black 15 are miai. 
]
;B[qm]C[
With Black 17, he plans to make territory here and on the lower 
edge while chasing these White stones. 
]
;W[pl];B[ql];W[on];B[lp];W[oi];B[oh];W[pj];B[qi];W[ni];B[nh];M[ni][nh]W[mi]C[
White 26 and 28 are like kikashi; they threaten to help the single 
White stone in the top right. 
]
;B[mh];W[qc]C[
White 30 is perfectly timed. 
];B[rc];W[pd];B[qe]C[
Black 33 takes the easy way. If Black played at "a".. 
]
;W[mc];B[ld];W[qb];B[hq];M[hq]W[ci]C[
Black 37 and white 38 are miai. Black has finally played on the 
left side of the board. 
]
;B[nl]C[
Black 39 is severe\: this is the vital point for eye-shape. 
];W[mm];B[nk]
;W[li];B[ll];W[ml];B[mk];W[lk];B[lj];W[kk];B[kj];W[mo];B[ol];W[jk];B[jj];W[ij];B[kh]
C[
Black 55 could cut at "a".. 
];M[ij][kh]W[ik]C[
Black has captured 6 White stones, but White 54 and 56 are very 
thick moves perfectly facing White's large prospects. Considering 
that there is still aji in the stones, White has com off better. 
ó|‘≠Œ‰–€ 9-dan commented that Black's capture was worth about 
as much as the bottom half of a broken match. 
]
;B[mp];W[ko];B[kp];W[jo];B[ip]C[
Black 61 is necessary. If Black plays elsewhere.. 
]
;W[jh];M[jh]B[ii]C[
White returns to exploit the aji and Black makes the strongest possible 
response. 
]
;W[hi];B[ih];W[ji];B[ki];L[kg][hh]W[jg]C[
White 68 makes miai of A or B. 
];B[hh]
;W[kg];B[lh];W[if];B[gi];W[hj];B[fg];L[dg][mf][mf]W[id]C[
White 76 makes miai of the two points marked A and B. 
]
;B[ei];W[mf];B[cf];M[cf]W[dk]C[
Black 79 and White 80 are also miai. However, if white played at 
"a".. 
]
;B[cc]C[
Black 81 seems risky, but Black has to make this sente invasion 
while he can. 
]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[fc];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[ce];B[ch];W[bh];B[di];W[cg];B[dh]
;W[bi];B[bg];W[bf];B[dg];W[gj]C[
Perhaps only Shuei could play such a slow move. White should probably 
play at "a2 instead. 
]
;B[ag];W[dj];B[ae];W[ee];M[ag][ae][ee][dj]B[af]C[
The result of Black 101 is that Black has completely settled himself, 
while White has sente. 
]
;W[rb];B[ga];W[fa];B[fb];W[gb];B[ea];W[op];B[oq];L[go][ia]W[fq]C[
White 14 is a very big move. It makes miai of A and B.

W[ir]C[
White 24 and 28 and Black 25 and 27 are miai. Both are quite big. 
];B[jq]
;W[fl]C[
White 30 is a good point for the defense of his group.

Black 41 to 45 are typical Shusai moves, wedgeing into small spaces 
and disrupting potential territory.

Black 57 is a big move, threatening White's central group.

White 176 looks small but..

White 78 is big. 
]
;B[or];W[rd];B[ek];W[el];B[rc];W[sm];B[sl];W[rd];B[hl];W[hg];B[gi]C[
White will find it difficult to win two kos with the weakness of 
his central group.

Black 37 and 39 are the spirit of prefessionalism; they give Black 
one extra ko threat even though he doesn't need it.

266 moves. Jigo.

(;AE[qo];M[dd]W[nd]C[
In conjunction with White \\t, a kakari at 1 seems to be a larger 
scale move. 
])
(;AE[qk];B[nc]C[
Black 1 starts to limit the White hoshi stone.

(;AE[qp];B[dq];W[ep];B[eq];W[fp];B[gq];W[cj]C[
If Black plays at 1, White will lean against him with 2 and 4 and 
then play 6 for an easy fuseki. 
])
(;AE[lc];B[fc];W[jc]C[
If Black plays at 1, white 2 is a good extension and pincer. 
]
(;AE[jc];W[df]C[
White could also play here and await Black's response. 
]))
(;AE[qe];B[qb];W[pc];B[qe]C[
If White meekly connected at 2 then Black would play at 3. 
]
(;AE[pc];W[qe];B[pc];W[rd];B[qc];W[pe]C[
However, white is more likely to play the sequence to 5, but he 
would still be troubled by lack of eyes. However, he has broken 
into Black's side.

(;AE[kh];B[ik];W[km]C[
But White 2 eliminates possibilities in this area.

White can capture at either A or B and solidify an enormous territory.

(;AE[dk];W[dg]C[
This is unlike White's style but something will probably die.

(;AE[gj];L[fb]W[ag]C[
White casn then threaten Black with A, which removes the possibilities 
which Black exploits later.
