;B[qd];W[dc]C[(* The 1st Japan's Strongest Deciding Matches are to have 30 games played.  This game is the 20th.  So 2/3 of the games have been played.

Wu 9-dan's record up to this point is 6 wins and 2 losses.  He has led far in front of other players, fully showing his extraordinarly strength. *)]
;B[pp]C[(* According to the rules, each player is to play 10 games.  Now [Wu\] has only 2 games left.  One is to play Fujisawa 9-dan, and the other is to play Kitani 9-dan.  Both these games will be 吴清源's turn to play black.  If everything goes as normal, the possibility that Wu will end up with an 8-2 record is high.  In recent years, 吴清源 9-dan has never lost playing black, so this prediction [8-2 record\] is reasonable.  Even with a conservative calculation, say 1 win and 1 loss in the remaining two games, the total will still be 7 wins and 3 losses, a 70% winning percentage.  Winning the title is unshakable. *)]
;W[cp]C[(* The players [other than Wu\] in this Japan's Strongest Deciding Matches have all beaten by 吴清源 (and beaten to BWB handicap -- they received sente in 2 out of 3 games).  In these Matches, no matter Wu's final standing will be 7-3 or 8-2, he will once again show his unbeatable form in 10-game series. *)]
;B[eq]C[(* In the beginning of this game, both side chose common fusekis.  Takagawa Honinbo displayed his simple and steady style, keeping the sente effect throughout, and after he successfully tackled tough obstacles in the middle game, he grabbed the lead. *) ]
;W[oc]C[(* 吴清源 9-dan saw the unfavorable situation.  He struggled by starting a ko fight, and the picture changed.  During the violent ko fight, Takagawa deliberated deeply.  After a long period of pondering, he delivered a famous and most extraordinary move, thus avoiding a local loss, and once again he passed an obstacle. *)]
;B[ce]C[(* However, at this very moment, Takagawa Honinbo was careless at a move that he should have made a forcing move, and the game was led to tension once again.  The confusing situation lasted all the way to almost the end.  Suddenly, Takagawa made a strange move, and the situation sharply turned worse for him.  Facing the losing situation, Takagawa started a ko fight, hoping to turn it around with it -- the game became violent again.  In this game, ko fights were complex and spectacular.  Hopefully, the readers will not only learn how to think around a ko, but also have a taste of the subtlety of ko. *)]
;M[cp][eq]L[hp]W[dh]C[W #8 pincer.  The common belief is that when there is a structure like W [C4\] and B [E3\] [marked\], W #8 to make pincer from this side is unfavorable.  This was already mentioned by "Kisei", the 4th Honinbo Dosaku Meijin [17th century\], in his fuseki theory, and it has become a principle ever since.  The reason is ---

[*** 'B' and 'C' to see references.\]

But here I had my own plan, so I decided to try W #8 pincer.

W #8 to play a pincer at [a\] is common sense, and it's used in many games.]

(;B[mr]C[B #23 severe.  A good move.

(* B #23 move was first played by 坂田荣男 9-dan.  The following is 吴清源 9-dan's brief explanation on B #23. *)

[*** 'B' to 'D' to see references.\]]
(;W[mq]C[Under B #23's [N2\] sudden attack, W feels uncomfortable and difficult.

In any case, there is no better way but to try to get out into the center.]
;B[nr];L[nq]W[oq]C[W #26, too, is of no choice.  If W blocks at [a\] instead, B would cut at [P3\] and W is in deeper trouble.]
;B[lq]C[B #27 is a steady and solid move.  This way B is of course not bad, but he could also consider the following variation.

[*** 'B' to see this variation.\]]
(;W[qm]C[W #28 connects.  This move is somewhat heavy, but considering the relation with the corner, W probably has to play here first.]
;B[rp];W[rq]C[When W #30, next move (B #31) ---

[*** 'B' to see a variation.\]]
(;B[qg]C[Therefore, B #31 is the most appropariate move.];W[mp]C[W #32 has to go out a little bit to be useful in middle game.]
;B[lp]C[B #33 to #35 are sure moves.

[*** 'B' to see a possible variation for #33.\]]
(;W[mo];B[om];W[pk]C[W #36 to #38 are also the only moves.];B[kn];W[mm]C[B on one hand chases W toward the center, on the other hand expands his moyo at the bottom.  B's pace is smooth and comfortable.]
;B[ok]C[When B #39 touches...];W[pj]C[W #40 extends; no choice.];B[mk]C[(* In this shape, #41 jump is tesuji.  Next --- *)

[*** 'B' to see a reference.\]]
(;M[mm]L[lm][dm]W[op]C[If W #42 does not "double" (making a bamboo joint) here, W is unable to get out with [N7\] [marked\] stone.  Also, without #42 ---

[*** 'B' to see a reference.\]

Now, when W #42, if B[a\] next, W[b\] pushes and thereafter no matter how big B tries to fence, B's moyo won't get too big.]
(;B[dm]C[B #43 and #45 sente to enlarge the moyo is good order.];W[cl];B[dl];L[ck]
W[dk]C[W[a\] instead of #46 would be a slack move.];L[dj][lm]B[ek]C[And when B #47, W[a\] next would be slow too.  Playing slow moves like this under the current situation, the W team at right side would be blocked by B[b\].

When B #47, next (W #48) ---

[*** 'B' to see a variation.\]]
(;W[ll]C[Therefore, W #48 to get out is emergent.];B[cn]C[B #49 and the moves followed gain big.  Since W was eager to get [M8\] point, to let B gain here is unavoidable.]
;W[bn];B[bo];W[bm];L[bp]B[cq]C[B #53 is the shape.  If B[a\] instead ---

[*** 'B' to see this variation.\]]
(;W[bp];B[oj];W[ph];B[qh]C[B #57 is the key point.  B just extends to see W's reaction.

[*** 'B' to see a variation for W's next move.\]]
(;W[oi]C[Currently, the emphasis is the center, so #58 hane this way is certain.]
;B[qi];W[pi];B[mi];W[of]C[B #61 [N11\] and W #62 also follow the trend of play.]
;B[ki]C[B #63 good point.

If B let W get this point, the sides of attacking and being attacked would be switched.]
;W[qc]C[B had gained in sente at lower left corner, then gained more territory at the right side.  Even if B's center moyo would get reduced, comparing the territories, B is better.]
;B[rc]C[Hereafter, as long as B's center group that was extended from the right does not get severe attack, as a whole, B still retains the sente advantage. 

[Recall that there is no komi in these Deciding Matches.\]]
;L[pd][mf][qf]W[qe]C[If #66 hane at [a\], B would play #66 and B's territory easily increases.  Also, after B has #66, when later B gets [b\], W's top and bottom two groups would face the danger of being cut.  W #66 sente to gain is the tesuji already aimed at when W played #62 [P14\].

Next (#67) if B[a\], W[c\] to capture 3 B stones, and W is better.]
;B[re]C[B #67 ---

[*** 'B' to see a variation.\]

So B #67 is the only choice.]
(;W[pd];B[rd];W[de]C[W #70 this move ---

[*** 'B' to see a variation.\]

#70, along with the following moves, are severe attack.]
(;B[df];W[cd];L[bf]B[ee]C[B #73 (and #75 next) really wants to play a[B14\], however ---

[*** 'B' to see a reference.\]]
(;W[dd];B[fg]C[B #75 has no choice. 

(If #75 plays at [B14\], it would be the same as in the reference diagram shown previously [node #73\].)]
;L[cf]W[hd]C[W #76 kosumi to gain territory at the top, competing with the B territory at the bottom.

Although to cut at [a\] is also a big move for W, but ---

(;B[jl];W[dj]C[After W #78 ---

[*** 'B' to see a reference.\]]
(;B[bf]C[Therefore B #79 to defend.  This move will not just be convenient for making an eye, but it is big by itself.]
;W[fj]C[W #80 jumps.  On one hand threatening the B group at the top, on the other hand preparing for an invasion to B's territory [at bottom\].]
;B[hg];W[dp];B[ep];W[jk]C[When W #84, next move (B #85) ---

[*** 'B' and 'C' to see variations.\]]
(;B[il]C[Therefore, B #85 has to play this way.];L[if]W[fk]C[If W #86 plays at [a\] ---

[*** 'B' to see this variation.\]]
(;B[ie]C[B #87 ---

[*** 'B' to see a variation.\]

In the game, #87's purpose is to mess up W's territory, and at the same time, seeking the connection between B's left and right teams.]
(;W[he];B[hf];W[gm]C[Consequently, W #90 jumps into B's territory becomes certain.

Both sides choose to trample opponent's lands.

(* If it's a handicap game, it would be different.  But in an even game, when opponent invades, if one only thinks of defending, it would be difficult for him to win.  To attack back in the same way is a normal showing of fighting spirit. *)]
;B[ke]C[B #91 good move.

[*** 'B' to see a reference.\]]
(;W[fo];B[eo];W[in];B[ho];L[qb][hp]W[hn]C[To W #96, the biggest point on the board is probably [a\] at upper right.

However, if B plays tenuki after #95 [H5\], W would have [b\] tesuji, so B cannot ignore here yet.]
;B[fn];W[gn];B[go]C[Again B #99 cannot tenuki.

[*** 'B' to see a reference.\]]
(;W[io];B[ip];W[jp];B[hq];W[qf];B[rf];W[qb]C[W finally gets to play #106, the biggest point on the board.]
;L[fl][gl][gk]B[ik]C[B #107 is very thick.  At the same time, it aims at B[a\]-W[b\]-B[c\] to cut W group.]
;L[kq][nq][kr][lo]W[lr]C[W #108 to test B's reaction.

If B[a\], W would have already gained on endgame.  In addition, W later has W[b\] sente to gain half an eye.  From this point of view, W #108 is a strong move.

Or, if B[c\] [against W #108\], W has [d\] to cut B.]
;L[bq][kc]B[id]C[B #109 to block at [a\] at lower left is also a big move.  If so, W would of course play [b\] next.

At this point, #109 is the thicker move.  After #109, B is still better.]
;W[kr];B[jr];W[bq];L[bd][bc][eb]B[ib]C[B #113 gives W chances to turn it around.

B #113 itself is not a bad move, for it creates B[c\] tesuji after B[a\]-W[b\] -- thus W cannot tenuki.  However, just because of #113, a peaceful board is suddenly violently disturbed.

B #113 should choose a vaiartion shown later [node #122\].]
;L[ic][jc][jb]W[hb]C[W #114 is necessary because of the B tesuji described previously.  But after #114, W now has the chance to play W[a\]-B[b\]-W[c\] to create a ko.]
;B[cr];W[rj];B[rb];W[kk];B[ij]C[To B #119, B is thick as a whole, and B's situation is better.  If W goes into endgame in normal ways, there is no way to catch up on territory.]
;W[ic];B[jc];W[jb]C[W last two moves to create a ko -- if W loses the ko, the loss would be tremendous.  To B, a nearly free ko like this is more or less welcome.

But to W, this is his only chance.  W #120 [J17\] is a do-or-die move.  Looking back ---

[*** 'B' to see a variation for B #113.\]]
(;B[hc];W[iq];B[ir];W[ic];L[fl]B[kq]C[B #127 is a good threat.  Next B[a\] would get six W stones.

If W answers here ---

[*** 'B' to see a reference.\]]
(;W[kc]C[Also, if W  captures at [J19\] (instead of [L17\], it would be small [not big enough to turn around, that is\]. So W decides to hane one more move to make the ko bigger, using this to decide the game.  This is the only choice for W now.]
;B[hc];W[nj];L[mj][lj]B[nk]C[If B finishes the ko here [connecting [J17\]\], W[a\]-B[b\] next, and when W [O9\], W's gain is much bigger than loss since W's upper left is not dead yet.]
;W[ic];L[fl]B[oe]C[After a long and deep deliberation, Takagawa delivered B #133, a move which was called a "famous move."

Before explaining B #133's purpose, let's look at two variations.

[*** 'B' and 'C' to see them.\]

Now let's study #133's [P15\]
effect.

If #133 can gain here in sente by pressing the W group at the upper side, *then* B turns to play [a\] to get W six stones, B would balance out the loss shown in variation 1, and B would lose nothing in the ko fight.  Not only that, B #133 prepares to get some territory at the center.]
(;W[jd]C[#134 to finish the ko is W's only choice.];B[pe];W[pf];B[od];W[pc];B[md]
;W[mc];B[me]C[The next few B moves are all sente.];W[ld];B[ng];W[ri];B[rh];L[qj][ni]
W[pg]C[After W #146 connects, either W[a\] or W[b\] is sente, so W [left team\] lives.

B gets territory at the center in sente -- this is all B #133's effect.]
;B[fl]C[To balance out what W gained in the ko fight at the upper edge, B #147 captures six W stones -- this is of course B's right, but this move is too early.  Now the situation becomes complex again.

[*** 'B' to see a variation.\]]
(;L[rn]W[je]C[Since B did not choose the variation shown previously, now after W #148 pushes through, B cannot hane at [a\] anymore.  If B[a\] ---

[*** 'B' to see a reference.\]]
(;B[kg];W[be];B[cf];W[bh];B[bd]C[B #153 ---

[*** 'B' to see a variation\]

But speaking of territory, B #153 is the biggest move.]

(;B[rn]C[Since B did not play #157 [S6\] until now ---];W[mj]C[W is able to invade B's territory...]

(;W[nh];B[jf];W[qj]C[And then W lives.

(* It's has become a very close game, but large scale battles are still going on.  Under this situation, gains and losses that are tiny bits to amateurs are in fact big enough to affect the result of the whole game.  Professional games are mostly so. *)]
;B[sh];W[rm]C[To here, W lives and B territory was invaded -- and #133, the move B made after long deliberation, has lost much of its effect.]
;L[ko]B[km]C[But when B gets #171 (which pervents Wa move [see variation 1 at node #133\]), it's still an extremely close game.  The outcome is uncertain.]

[*** 'B' to see a variation for W #178.\]

[But\] W has #178, a great move.  This move aims at W[a\] to save the few W stones below, and if B tries to prevent W[a\], B[b\] peep [as shown in the variation\] will no longer work, and B #177 stone would be a free gift.]
(;B[ei];W[ej];B[di];W[gl];B[bi];W[cj]C[To here, B's loss is clearly bigger in the exchange.

(* After the game, 藤泽朋斋 9-dan, who was watching the game, asked Takagawa sensei, when B played #177, did he overlooked W #178.  Takagawa's answer was, "No, I saw W #178.  I played so for the exchange." However, the result of exchange was clearly bad for B, and he still chose to play this way -- this was quite hard to understand.  Anyway, no matter it was B's miscalculation on the exchange, or B's misjudgment on the whole board -- thinking that B had already trailed, so he looked for change -- this B #177 was indeed questionable, and 吴清源 9-dan's comment that #177 was the losing move was understandable. *)
