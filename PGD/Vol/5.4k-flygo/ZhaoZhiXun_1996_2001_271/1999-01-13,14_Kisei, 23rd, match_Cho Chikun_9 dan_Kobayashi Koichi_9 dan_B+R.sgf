were added and marked as such.

are both perfectly good points. White's last move

the option to settle the marked stone by extending to B or 12.

(see diagram).]

way to play (which is shown in the diagram).

as explained in the diagram.];B[be];W[cg]TR[cf][cj]C[This was the move white was aiming at when he played
the marked move. White is trying to disturb the relation

at A black will play as in the diagram.]

enabled black to settle a group here.

gave three possibilities (see diagrams).]

marked stone.];B[ef];W[de]C[This was black's idea: white has very bad shape now.

clear how white can recover from this very inefficient
local result.];B[ch];W[ci]

it with this move.];B[hq]LB[gq:A][hp:B]C[Prevents white A and sets up black B as follow-up move
